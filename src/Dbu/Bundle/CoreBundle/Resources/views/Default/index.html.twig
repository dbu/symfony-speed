<h1>The Symfony2 Frontend Performance Demo Site</h1>
<p>
    This site is a tutorial for Symfony2 frontend performance steps. The code
    has a couple of branches that show different steps of optimization.
    The functionality of the application does not change.
</p>
<p>
    Please read the <a href="https://github.com/dbu/symfony-speed/wiki">project wiki</a>
    for documentation about the various branches. This project runs on pure
    symfony without even a database. The only additional dependency for the
    advanced steps is the caching reverse proxy Varnish.
